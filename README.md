# Tree_based_models

Welcome to a game of poker. Each record in this competition consists of five playing cards and an attribute representing the poker hand. You are asked to predict the best hand you can play based on the cards you've been dealt. 

You will be working on a kaggle competition and the data can be found here [Poker Rule Induction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/poker-rule-induction). You are asked to use a shallow model, including tree based models. Using both bagging and boosting methods, fine tune the hyperparameters to choose the best model.
